# A self-driving RC Car project

This repository holds some of the larger source files for my Master's thesis project: a self-driving RC car:

- The CustomSimulator branch contains the final release of a custom/modified simulator made in Unity.
- The DonkeyCar branch contains the final version of the DonkeyCar project for the RC.
- The master branch contains some notebooks and the finished Master's thesis itself.

#### [Please take a look at the official website](https://ori.codes) for the entire project write-up with source code and various demonstrations.

# Stores

Stores are parts that record and replay vehicle data produced by other parts.

## Tub

This is the standard donkey data store and it is modeled after the ROSBAG.

> TODO: The structure of the Tub part is not ideal and should be changed.


> * types should not need to be specified and could be inspected and saved
on the first loop.

Example creation

```python
import donkey as dk

T = dk.parts.Tub(path, inputs, types)

```

### Accepted Types

* `float` - saved as record
* `int` - saved as record
